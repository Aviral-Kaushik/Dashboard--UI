# Dashboard--UI

Introducing "Dashboard--UI" - a sleek and intuitive dashboard user interface application developed by me, as part of my journey to enhance my UI design skills. This GitHub project showcases a beautifully crafted, one-screen application focused on providing users with a seamless and delightful credit card management experience.

The "Dashboard" app features an elegant and modern design, highlighting essential animations etc.

With a strong emphasis on user experience, the application incorporates smooth animations and interactive elements, ensuring a visually appealing and engaging interaction. The clean layout and carefully chosen color schemes contribute to a visually harmonious experience.
